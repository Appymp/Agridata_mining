Master's Thesis
“To build an interactive NLP dashboard tool to understand prevalent user perspectives around the concept of #organic as inferred from Instagram posts. The tool allows us to explore word frequency, posts frequency by unique word, word co-occurrence counts, and word embeddings, which we use to deep dive into the concept of ‘organic food’ as a test case.”
